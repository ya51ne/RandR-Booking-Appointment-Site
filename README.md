This project aims to create a high-level website using Replit to develop the front-end, including content pages and a Booking Appointment feature. N8N will be used for the workflow automation to enable bookings to be confirmed based on treatment and date/time. Emails will also be configured so that the sender and recipient will have a receipt of the actions taken. A further automation will be added in N8N to allow the business owner to block time out through the use of Google Calendar. This will then be reflected on the website as 'unavailable', preventing the customer from choosing any blocked times within the Preferred Time drop-down.
