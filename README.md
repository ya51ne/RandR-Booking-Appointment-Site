This project is to create a high level website using Replit to create the front end with content pages and Booking Appointment feature
A back office admin area will be created so that the content can be managed and updated as and when is required
N8N will be used for the workflow automation to enable bookings to be confirmed based on treatment and date/time. Emails will also be configured so that the sender and recipient will have a receipt of the actions taken
